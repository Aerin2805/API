PROBLEM STATEMENT 1
The number of crimes being reported has been increasing day by day. People are
often in a state of panic and confusion during an emergency and are unable to
properly report the crime to the relevant authorities. This leads to a delay in
response time and can result in further harm being done. To tackle this issue, we
challenge you to build a chat-bot that can help individuals quickly and efficiently
report crimes to the respective authorities and suggest preventive measures for
emergency scenarios.
The chat-bot should be user-friendly and able to gather relevant information from
the individual reporting the crime, such as the type of crime, location, and any other
relevant details. It should also be able to provide immediate assistance by
suggesting preventive measures and connecting the individual to the relevant
authorities. The chat-bot should be accessible through multiple platforms, such as
websites, mobile applications, and social media, to ensure widespread availability
and accessibility.
It should be designed in such a way that it ensures the privacy and confidentiality of
the individual reporting the crime. The chat-bot should also be able to handle
multiple languages to cater to a larger audience.
We believe that such a chat-bot has the potential to revolutionize the way crimes
are reported and can help reduce response time, improve safety, and increase
efficiency in emergency situations. So, join us in this challenge and build a chat-bot
that can make a real impact!
